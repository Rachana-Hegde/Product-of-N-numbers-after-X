# ✖️ Product of N Numbers After X – Python Program

This is a small Python program that calculates the **product of `N` consecutive numbers after a given number `X`**. It’s useful for understanding loops and arithmetic operations in Python.

## 📌 Description

* The user is prompted to enter two numbers:

  * `a` → Starting number (after which to begin multiplication)
  * `b` → Number of terms to multiply
* The program calculates the product of `b` consecutive numbers starting **after** `a`.

### 🧾 Sample Input & Output

**Input:**

```
Enter starting number (a): 3  
Enter how many numbers to multiply (b): 4
```

**Output:**

```
840
```

**Explanation:**

```
Product = 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 = 840
```

## 🧠 Logic

* Start a loop from `a + 1` to `a + b` (inclusive).
* Multiply each number and accumulate the result in a `result` variable initialized to 1.
* Print the final product.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `product_after_x.py`
2. Run the script using Python:
```bash
python product_after_x.py
```
3. Enter values for `a` and `b` as prompted.

## 🎯 Use Case

* Great for beginners learning:
  * `for` loops
  * Range and arithmetic operations
  * User input handling

* Can be extended to calculate:
  * Sum instead of product
  * Only even/odd products
  * Products in reverse order
